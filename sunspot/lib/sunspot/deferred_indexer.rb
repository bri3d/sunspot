module Sunspot
  # 
  # This class presents a service for adding, updating, and removing data
  # from the Solr index. An Indexer instance is associated with a particular
  # setup, and thus is capable of indexing instances of a certain class (and its
  # subclasses).
  #
  # This DeferredIndexer provides deferred (queued) indexing via Resque.
  # Thus, updates will be FIFO and will occur in the same way they would normally
  # with the exception that there are no guarentees as to when updates will occur
  # and that errors are handled offline rather than in-application.
  # This allows indexing without blocking a user-facing task, crucial when a large
  # index makes addition and deletion take a significant time.
  # Indexing is deferred here (at the lowest level) to provide the widest range 
  # of compatibility, including compatibility with sunspot_rails and its automated
  # indexing functionality.

  # The DeferredIndexer class is the "client" - it places indexing operations onto
  # the message queue.
